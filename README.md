# Image-Captioning-Using-LSTMs-and-CNNs
This is a project focused on generating descriptive captions for images using a combination of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This innovative approach leverages the power of CNNs for image feature extraction and LSTMs for generating contextually relevant captions, providing a seamless fusion of vision and natural language processing.

## Key Features
### LSTM-CNN Fusion:
Integrating LSTMs and CNNs to capitalize on their respective strengths for accurate and contextually rich image captions.
### State-of-the-Art Models:
Implementing cutting-edge deep learning models to ensure superior image feature extraction and caption generation.
### Transfer Learning:
Utilizing pre-trained CNN models for efficient feature extraction, allowing the model to generalize well to various types of images.

## Usage
### Image Captioning:
Provide an image as input, and witness the generation of descriptive captions using the trained LSTM-CNN model.

### Custom Training:
Train the model on your own dataset to adapt it to specific domains or image characteristics.
